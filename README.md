# BM
The utility to install Songs, install mods, install/update BMBF, install HitSounds, download automatically made playlists, get better support, switch between modded and unmodded Beat Saber versions, do full Backups and way more
# How-to
## **In order for BM to work, you need to enable Developer Mode on your Quest. Here is an excellent [written tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/enable-developer-mode) and here is an excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYzK1X_A4LQ&t=30).**
## **Go to [releases](https://github.com/ComputerElite/BM/releases/) and download the zip file first. Then right click the downloaded zip and extract the file.**
## The First Time you launch the program it asks you for administrative access. If you want the best support click yes, otherwise click no. (This can be changed any time in settings)
